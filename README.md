# Predictive-Analysis-On-Climate-Change
As of my Final year project, we made a Machine Learning program that used the historical data of different climatic factors of Pakistan and predicted the next 5-10 years of them. 
The objective of this project is to asses climate change factors and further predict how these factors will change in the future effecting the climate. In this project different models are being used to predict the climate changing factors. Furthermore using these predictions to accurately predict global climate change and its effects on the environment of Pakistan.
